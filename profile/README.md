# Pterodactyl Client Development

Pterodactyl Client is a client based client that modifies your game to its limits. This client is based on 1.8.9 and 1.12, 1.14, 1.16 and so on. This client will also provide a large amount of performance boost, with the help of OptiFine, Sodium, EntityCull, and more.

# Status of the client

The client, and the source code isnt really published to the public yet. But it will soon.
